Each finite-energy pulse or waveform can be associated with a complex function called the ambiguity function. The ambiguity function is used to describe the joint time-frequency characteristics of a signal and is essentially equivalent to a time-matched filter, which in one dimension corresponds to a crossl correlation function. The two-dimensional time-matched filter is the time delay-Doppler filter, which corresponds to the sampling cross ambiguity function. It is widely used to assess the suitability of an impulse for a particular radar or sonar application. The ambiguity function is classified into auto-ambiguity function and cross-ambiguity function.
For finite-energy signals y(t):
Its auto-ambiguity function can be considered as the correlation between the 'movement' of the signal y(t) in time and frequency and its 'movement' in the opposite direction in time and frequency.
Its cross-ambiguity function describes the correlation between y(t) and another signal under the action of time delay and frequency shift.
